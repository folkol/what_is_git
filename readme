1) What is Git?

'Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.'

'A hash map'


2) There hash map can store three kinds of objects
   - blob
   - tree
   - commit

n) And that is why git push -f is better represented by someone turning a sign!






Ta upp:
   - commits as snapshots of the working tree
   - git object types
   - branches (och andra reffar) = pekare till commit objects
